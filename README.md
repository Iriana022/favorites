# Favorites Manager App

This project is a Favorites Manager application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and organize favorite items efficiently. Key features include:

CRUD operations – add new favorites, edit existing ones, and delete items.

Grouping by category – dynamically group favorites for better organization.

Modals for forms – add and edit items using reusable modal components.

The application is built with:

React + Vite – for a modern and fast frontend experience.

React Bootstrap – for responsive and clean UI components.

Redux Toolkit – for centralized state management and immutability.

Minimal local state – used sparingly with useState for UI controls, such as modals.

This project demonstrates practical skills in state management, component design, and UI/UX best practices using modern React tools.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration 

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
